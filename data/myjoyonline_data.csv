0,https://www.myjoyonline.com/residents-of-tamale-kick-against-proposed-tariff-increase/,"  Some residents in the Northern Region are kicking against the proposed increase in utility tariffs by the utility companies in Ghana. According to the residents, the companies do not merit any increment because of the inefficient service they continue to offer.Major utility companies such as the Ghana Water Company Limited and the Electricity Company of Ghana among others, last month proposed some new tariff adjustment which triggered huge public reactions. The Public Utilities Regulatory Commission [PURC] began engagement with Ghanaians through its public forums. PURC has so far held four public forums with the Tamale forum making it five.Speaking to JoyNews, Alhassan Imoro,  a resident,  questioned the moral  justification of the utility companies demanding increment  when they have failed to consult the consumers  first before coming out with the proposed increase,  adding that the increment would further worsen the burden of Ghanaians.   “If you proposed your targets without consulting the people it means that you’re going to fail because we should have been consulted before the increment;  you go into people’s homes and you see standpipes over three months with no drop of water and at the end of the month, they bring bills. For me, this tariff increment is not achievable at all because we don’t get the right services we pay for,” he said.Another resident, Yahaya Yussif, said the people are unhappy about the rates being proposed because it does not reflect in the services the utility companies provide.“We have noticed in recent times that VRA and NEDCo for instance have been adjusting their rates but with poor quality service delivery; almost all communities within Tamale are receiving low voltage which is damaging our gadgets,” he said.Mr. Yahaya however urged the utility providers to rather be working on how to improve their services and not to pass on additional costs to consumers whom he said are already paying too much.  Ahmed Rufai is a pure water producer and lamented the cost of raw materials and water treatment.“I’m a sachet water producer and if I want to get more market, it means that I have to improve the quality of my water and not to increase the price and expect costumers or consumers to buy so that I can get money before I improve on my water,” he noted.The Chief Executive Officer of the Consumers  Protection Agency Kofi Kapito who was at the forum charged the utility providers to demand their debt from government institutions as well as private individuals to help address their financial challenges.He said, “the law is you use you pay and everybody in Ghana is entitled to use and also entitled to pay, it’s as simple as that and that’s fairness”.  Mr. Kapito cautioned Ghanaians over their heavy reliance on the government for freebies. According to him, there is nothing government gives for free.“Anytime government tells PURC don’t push it on or pass on to consumers is not free, it is set aside we pay at the end of the day; this free water and free electricity that they gave us during the covid we are paying for it. Government is not a charity, government will find money and let you pay taxes for him to offset it so we should not be all happy it’s just a relief instead of you paying it today you pay it tomorrow” he stated.Executive Secretary of the PURC, Dr. Ishmael Ackah, on his part said there have been varied opinions since they started the public engagement with complaints of poor customer services by the utility companies among other concerns adding that as a regulatory commission they will continue to engage the service providers on how they can improve on customer service.“The feedback we are getting so far is varied however the main concern has been customer service, so if I apply for a meter and I don’t know a big man how long does it take to get it? If I face a challenge and I come to you how responsive is the utility taking customer concerns?” He said.

31,https://www.myjoyonline.com/water-crisis-hit-aboadze-abuesi-communities/,"  Residents of Aboadze and Abuesi, two fishing communities in the Shama District of the Western Region, have been battling perennial water shortage for the past nine months.   Trekking to the Volta River Authority (VRA) area and to Inchaban, a nearby town with the yellow gallons, popularly known as ‘Kufuor gallons,’ in search of water have become a daily routine for the residents, particularly women and children.   The situation, they say, is affecting their socio-economic activities.  In an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), the assembly members for the two communities; Mr Emmanuel Avevor for Aboadze, and Mr Ezekiel Acquah, for Abusie, and some unit committee members, indicated that efforts to get the problem solved had not been successful.     They said information from the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) indicated that the problem was due to the dysfunction of old pipelines, which were laid through Nyankrom, a suburb of Shama, to supply water to the two communities.   A visit to the booster station of GWCL at Inchaban by Mr Avevor and some unit committee members confirmed the explanation by management of the GWCL that the inner layer of the pipelines had been corroded, thereby partially blocking the easy flow of water.   Mr Avevor, however, blamed the situation on the activities of the Twyford Ceramic Tiles Company, operating in the area, which drew water from the said pipelines to manufacture their products to the detriment of the communities.     He expressed the belief that the activities of the company had aggravated the water crisis of the twin fishing communities.   He, therefore, appealed to the Takoradi International Company (TICO/TAQA) and the VRA to, as a matter of urgency, commit financial resources to either divert or construct new pipelines from Inchaban to Aboadze and Abuesi.     According to the GWCL, GHC2,432,556.00 was needed to lay new pipelines to the communities.     Though management of the two companies; TICO/TAQA and the VRA, accepted the request in good faith, the huge cost has made them disinterested in furthering the funding.       However, Nana Kobina Attom III, Chief of Aboadze, and Nana Amakye II, the Abusie Chief, have expressed worry over the situation after several attempts to find an effective remedy had hit a snag, while the people struggled for water on daily basis.   They bemoaned the lackadaisical stance of the Shama District Assembly in helping to solve the problem having been notified several months ago.   The chiefs pleaded with the Assembly to attach some importance to their plight and put in place effective measures to address the problem, as “water is life”.   All efforts to get the Assembly for its side of the story has proved futile.

34,https://www.myjoyonline.com/fix-your-inefficiencies-proposed-increase-in-utility-tariffs-too-high-consumers-tell-ecg-gwcl/,"  Consumers of water and electricity have asked the utility companies to significantly reduce the percentage they are demanding with regard to the upward adjustment in tariff.The consumers said the increase in utility tariffs is too high.The ECG is demanding a 148% increase in tariff. A proposal from the power distributor, submitted to the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC), wants the adjustment to cover the period 2019 and 2022. It also proposed an average increase of 7.6% in tariff over the next four years to cover Distribution Service Charges (DSC).The Ghana Water Company Limited is also demanding a 334% increase in tariff. The GWCL in its proposal, said over the years, the approved tariffs have not been fully cost-reflective.According to the consumers, they do not agree that the increase in utility tariff is commensurate with the services retendered.  The consumers expressed these concerns at a public forum organised by the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC). The PURC is engaging the public as part of the process to review the current tariffs.   Speaking at the engagement at the University of Ghana, a utility consumer lamented the frequent unexpected power outages without prior notice.“It is rather unfortunate the services ECG and other institutions are offering us are not helping us, because it seems you keep on increasing the prices, but we keep on experiencing poor performance,” he said.JoyNews/AdomNews · Utility tariff proposed increase is too high, we want significant increase – ConsumersAccording to him, although he is not against an increase, he believes that “it shouldn’t be too much whereby it will affect businesses.”  He explained that his plea is because “a lot of people are finding it difficult even to pay the existing one.”“All that I am saying is that they have to look at those who don’t have meters and then give them meters, whereby they will pay exactly what we consume, so it wouldn’t look as if those people are using power and water and not paying,” he stressed.He urged utility providers to improve their services to facilitate an increase in their revenue to effectively run the institution.Meanwhile, utility providers say their businesses are on the line and only an increase in tariffs would keep them in business.
